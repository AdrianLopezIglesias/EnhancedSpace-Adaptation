## Disclaimer
I have not been part of the original team that developed this mod. I am just a user who likes it very much and happends to know how to program.
I've just created my own repository for this mod, changing some main things that I didn't like or that I would like to be different.


## Changelog

In every session I found out that I maxed out population really fast, without even trying it, and never needed advanced Food technologies or improvements.
In order to fix this issue two main changes were added. First allowing the systems to grow really large. Second, making it harder to grow a system. 
The idea behind this modifications is to incentivise the competitiveness of the Food mechanic, as well pacifist civilizations and make small empires with huge systems a competitive approach. 
- Added an exponential incrementation to the grow population formula
- Steepen the curve of population upkeep 
- Increased (bastly) the maximum population for each planet

This is still being calibrated and values will be updated.
